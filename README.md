# Java DSA Programs

This repository contains two Java programs demonstrating basic **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts:

1. **`pracArray.java`** – Shows operations on arrays such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.
2. **`pracLinkedList.java`** – Demonstrates linked list operations like adding nodes, deleting nodes, and traversing the list.

These programs are ideal for beginners who want to understand **core data structures in Java** and practice implementing them.

### **1. Prerequisites**

Before running the programs, ensure that you have:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or above). Check with:

  ```bash
  java -version
  ```

* A terminal or command prompt (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

* Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

---

### **2. Clone the Repository**

Download the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gayatri1908/Java_DSA.git
cd Java_DSA
```

---

### **3. Compile the Programs**

Compile the Java files using `javac`:

* For the array program:

```bash
javac pracArray.java
```

* For the linked list program:

```bash
javac pracLinkedList.java
```

> Compiling creates `.class` files which are executable bytecode.

---

### **4. Run the Programs**

After compiling, run the programs using `java`:

```bash
java pracArray
```

```bash
java pracLinkedList
```

> The program output will display in your terminal. Ensure you use the correct class name containing the `main` method.

### **5. Optional: Run Online**

If you don’t want to install Java locally, you can run these programs online:

* [Replit](https://replit.com/)
* [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/)

Upload the `.java` file and execute it directly in the browser.

---

### ✅ **Summary**

* `pracArray.java` → Array operations
* `pracLinkedList.java` → Linked list operations
* Compile with `javac` and run with `java`
* Can also be run online for quick testing

This setup makes it **easy for anyone to try and learn** basic data structures in Java.
